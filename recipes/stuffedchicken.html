  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p>An ad on TV sparked the idea for this recipe, and its become a family favorite. I<br> usually serve with fettuccini and Italian bread. It makes a very filling and delicious<br> meal. It also is elegant enough to serve for company.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>1.5 cups shredded italian cheese blend</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1.5 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>& more..</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine 1 1/2 cup Italian cheese blend, garlic, basil, and oregano in a bowl. Combine Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs in a separate bowl.</li>
    <li>Cut one side of each chicken breast through the middle horizontally to within one-half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread<br> them out like an open book. Lightly pound chicken to flatten. Fill each chicken breast with Italian cheese blend mixture and close like a book over the filling.<br> Coat the outside of each chicken breast with egg; press bread crumb mixture over egg<br> layer to coat each chicken breast. Arrange chicken breasts in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read<br> thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Pour spaghetti sauce over cooked chicken; top with 1/4 cup Italian cheese blend. Bake until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes.</li>
  </ol>
